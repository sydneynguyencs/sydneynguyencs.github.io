# Intro


My name is Sydney, and welcome to my first blog post. I did my Bachelor's in Computer Science where I wrote a thesis about using machine learning to identify false information in social media, specifically Tweets. I believe, this kind of research is useful in today's digital age, where false information can have serious consequences. As a result of this, I became intrigued by Artificial Intelligence (AI) as it can be used to solve current problems. In this EVA AI seminar, I would like to learn more about AI, specifically explainable AI, so that I can interpret the black box and understand what it does. To do so, I will need to gain experience working with scientific resources, such as reading a paper with limited knowledge. Additionally, I would like to learn how to communicate in a scientific setting and debate topics with peers from the same scientific community. This blog post is the first of many that will follow throughout the seminar, documenting my progress in learning and understanding about a specific AI topic.
